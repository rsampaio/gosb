## Methods

### NewAsyncOperation

`func NewAsyncOperation() *AsyncOperation`

NewAsyncOperation instantiates a new AsyncOperation object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewAsyncOperationWithDefaults

`func NewAsyncOperationWithDefaults() *AsyncOperation`

NewAsyncOperationWithDefaults instantiates a new AsyncOperation object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetOperation

`func (o *AsyncOperation) GetOperation() string`

GetOperation returns the Operation field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetOperationOk

`func (o *AsyncOperation) GetOperationOk() (*string, bool)`

GetOperationOk returns a tuple with the Operation field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetOperation

`func (o *AsyncOperation) SetOperation(v string)`

SetOperation sets Operation field to given value.

### HasOperation

`func (o *AsyncOperation) HasOperation() bool`

HasOperation returns a boolean if a field has been set.
